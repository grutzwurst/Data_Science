\section{Excercise DSI-01}
A) Read the PWC Report from the reference section.
What areas are covered to have a huge impact by data science?
B) Read the McKinsey Report on AI.
Do you agree and understand exhibit 8? Are there steps missing?
Half page for each topic is fine.

\section{Excercise DSI-02}
Make up your own example of a machine learning task with a binary classification
with your own numbers. Like e.g. recognising skin cancer. Calculate precision and re-
call.

\section{Excercise DSI-03}
What is the F1 measure of your example? (real calculation needed here).
