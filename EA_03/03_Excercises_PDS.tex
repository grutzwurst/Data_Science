\maketitle

\section{IDE Set Up}
\textit{A1: Set up a sound development environment. Minimum is Sublime Text.}

\section{Dive into Python}
\textit{A2: Code a little game in Python as Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, Word Guessing / Hangman, Othello, etc. Note that there is no fancy graphics required! Console apps are ok!}

\section{NumPy}
\textit{A3: If you have not done so already, really work through the Quickstart Tutorial from NumPy \footnote{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html}}

\section{101 NumPy}
\textit{If you have not done so already, really work through ALL the 101 NumPy exercises\footnote{https://www.machinelearningplus.com/101-numpy-exercises-python/}. A great way to start from scratch!}

\section{Handson Notebook}
\textit{A5: This is also a wonderful introduction via a notebook \footnote{https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/tools\_numpy.ipynb}}

\section{Pandas}
\textit{A6: If you have not done so already, really work through the 10 min Tutorial from Pandas\footnote{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html}}

\section{SciPy}
\textit{A7: Now work through the tutorials given in the second section here:\footnote{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/}. Much of the math is hard here but if something looks understandable to you (as basic distribution handling, etc.), then play with it.}
