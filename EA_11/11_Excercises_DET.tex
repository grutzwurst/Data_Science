\maketitle

\section{}

\textit{Find some data here \hyperref{https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E3bFrHnMGGmBgyAk9vAVnHGpQ8Z_asOP}{}{}{[1]} on people. The goal is to decide if someone buys a computer or not. Derive the best decision tree by calculating a little by hand (Shannon). At least the first split. }


\section{}

\textit{Compare your tree against the tree derived from SciKit Learn as given in the Python example before! Why are they different? Print the tree with Graphviz (can be easily done with \hyperref{http://www.webgraphviz.com/}{category}{name}{WebGraphViz [2]})}
